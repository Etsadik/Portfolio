        Inflammation in atopic dermatitis is mediated in part by the chemokine CCL1 and its receptor, CCR8. Recombinant Molluscum contagiosum viral protein (rMC148p), a cc-chemokine homolog, inhibits CCL1-induced chemotaxis of cells expressing CCR8. rMC148p was prepared using the baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell expression system. The recombinant MC148 fusion protein (rMC148fp), rMC148-TAT-6xHis, was similarly prepared by adding base sequences onto the PCR primers to fuse TAT and 6xHis to rMC148p at the carboxyl terminus. rMC148fp retains the capacity of rMC148p to inhibit CCL1-induced chemotaxis. Furthermore, unlike rMC148p, topically applied rMC148fp penetrates stratum corneum of human neonatal foreskins and concentrates along the basal and lower spinous cell layers of the epidermis. rMC148fp may be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of atopic dermatitis and other CCR8-mediated disorders.
