        I answered directly to the head director of Children’s Hospital Research Institute (CHORI), and I was in charge of leading the weekly status updates in lab meetings and on conference calls. Our lab collaborated with some very prestigious partners including the 2006 Nobel Laureate, Dr. Andrew Fire in Stanford, as well as the with Novartis. We proudly met and exceeded all of our milestones and agreements with these collaborators.
