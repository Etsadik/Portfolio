<h1>Impostor Syndrome: I’m All Alone in my Ignorance</h1>
<div class="text">
    What is the imposter syndrome and where does it come from? In its simplest form the imposter syndrome is assessing your abilities (any field) and determining or feeling that you do not belong. It was first discovered and analyzed in women whom held high level and prestigious academic positions in the late 70’s. During that time, women joining the work force was becoming more common, but still taboo for them to hold high level positions. Being the among the first women to hold high level positions, they (understandably) experienced imposter syndrome when working along side their male counterparts.</div>
<div class="text">
    The key factor that leads to the imposter syndrome is competition. Since the beginning of time, humans (and all living creatures) have been in competition with one another. Whether you like to admit it or not, competition drives some of the most basic functions in nature. The strongest and most fit individuals will survive and the weakest competitors will die off. In today’s times, competition and fitness isn’t a direct matter of life or death, but still has many links to how an individual will survive and the way in which they will live. Even in our modern and complex society the basics of competition are still alive and well; out compete your neighbor, and you will prosper. Be out competed and you will suffer. Fear of being publicly out competed (how ever primitive it sounds) plays a key role in the imposter syndrome.

    Imposter Syndrome: Common inTechnical Occupations</div>
<div class="text">
    In computer programing and software engineering imposter syndrome is very prevalent. This maybe in part due to tech being a very expansive and broad subject in which each person knows different information, and might even have a different understanding (both correct) on how it works. Perhaps this ‘different understanding’ is where some of the imposter syndrome stems.</div>
<div class="minititle">My Mind is Playing Tricks on Me</div>
<div class="text">
    I have always had a fabricated idea of what a successful computer programer/software engineer knows, how he acts, and even what he looks like. He knows everything, acts sophisticated, and looks nothing like me. This is the wrong path to take. There is a difference between being incompetent and feeling incompetent. The biggest enemy we have is our selves. We tell ourselves that we cant do something because we don’t look like that person in our mind. In reality there is no cookie cutter predetermined form to becoming a successful software engineer.</div>
<div class="minititle">Overcoming the Imposter Syndrome
<ol class="list">
    <li>
        There seems to be a disconnect between how we perceive our abilities, and our actual abilities. One method to overcoming the imposter syndrome is to keep a record of all the failures and successes you have in a field. Later down the line the record can be reviewed and provide evidence that you are not an imposter.
    </li>
    <li>
        Talk with other people in your field and get a sense of how they perceive themselves and how they deal with the syndrome. It might be hard to admit your self-doubt to your peers but worth while in the end. Even role models, or people you admire and look up to suffer from the some insecurities relating to the imposter syndrome. Gaining this knowledge might give you a better angle to examine your own insecurities more effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        working hard and don’t become distracted with not feeling like an imposter. The focus should be the work, not avoiding feeling like an imposter. Easier said than done.

    </li>
</ol>

<div class="text">
    Imposter syndrome is a debilitating mind state that is hard to shake in part because of the SELF assessment. With a little work, evidence can be gathered to prove to yourself that you’re not an imposter and worthy of belonging.
